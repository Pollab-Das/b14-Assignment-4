TypeScript Problem-Solving Assignment

General Rules
Do not change the function names. Use the exact name given in each problem.
Every problem must be solved using a function.
Every function must return a value. Do not use console.log() as the final answer.
Use appropriate TypeScript types for function parameters, function return values, objects, and arrays.
Avoid using any.
You may use JavaScript/ES6 features such as map(), filter(), reduce(), and template literals.
Check your function against every row in the test case table, not just the first one.
Think about edge cases — like an empty array — before considering a problem complete.


Problem 1 — Battery Level Status
Function name must be: getBatteryStatus

Scenario
A phone's settings screen shows a friendly battery status label instead of just the raw percentage.

Task
Create a function named getBatteryStatus. The function receives the battery percentage (0–100) and returns a status string.

Status Rules
Percentage
Status
0–20
"Low"
21–50
"Medium"
51–90
"High"
91–100
"Full"


Function Requirement
Accept the percentage as a number.
Return the status as a string.

Starter Code
function getBatteryStatus(percentage: <type>): <type> {
    // write your code here
}


Test Cases
Input
Output
10
"Low"
35
"Medium"
75
"High"
100
"Full"



Problem 2 — Table Booking Confirmation
Function name must be: formatBookingConfirmation

Scenario
A restaurant booking app confirms a table reservation with a short readable message. A booking contains name, guests, and time.

Task
First define an appropriate type or interface for the booking. Then create a function named formatBookingConfirmation that receives a booking and returns a confirmation sentence.

Requirements
Accept a properly typed booking object.
Return a string.
Use the values from the object rather than hard-coding the result.

Starter Code
function formatBookingConfirmation(booking: <type>): <type> {
    // write your code here
}


Test Cases
Input
Output
{ name: "Aisha", guests: 4, time: "7:00 PM" }
"Aisha's table for 4 guests is confirmed at 7:00 PM."
{ name: "Rahim", guests: 2, time: "8:30 PM" }
"Rahim's table for 2 guests is confirmed at 8:30 PM."



Problem 3 — Weekly Expense Tracker
Function name must be: calculateWeeklyTotal

Scenario
A budgeting app lets a user log each expense for the week as a plain number, and needs to add them all up.

Task
Create a function named calculateWeeklyTotal. The function should receive an array of expense amounts and return the total.

Requirements
Properly type the array of numbers.
Return the total as a number.
An empty array should return 0.


Starter Code
function calculateWeeklyTotal(expenses: <type>): <type> {
    // write your code here
}


Test Cases
Input
Output
[200, 450, 100]
750
[1000, 250]
1250
[]
0




Problem 4 — Traffic Light Action
Function name must be: getTrafficAction
Scenario
A driving simulator app tells the player what action to take based on the current traffic light color.

"green"
"Go"





Problem 5 — Quiz Score Summary
Function name must be: getQuizSummary

Scenario
A quiz app wants to show a simple summary of a student's scores across all questions: the total and the average.

Task
Create a function named getQuizSummary. The function should receive an array of scores and return an object containing total and average.

Starter Code
function getQuizSummary(scores: <type>): <type>  {
    // write your code here
}



Test Cases
Input
Output
[8, 9, 7, 10]
